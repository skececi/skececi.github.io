About Me:

Having graduated from [The Pingry School][pingry] on June 12, 2016, I now prepare to attend [Columbia University][columbia] in the fall. 

I was accepted into the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) and plan to pursue a degree in Operations Research and Financial Engineering, which is essentially just a way of using computer science and math to design efficient systems. [You can read more about the ORFE department here][ORFE].

Aside from academics, I have been a passionate soccer player, referee, and fan throughout my life. I've been lucky enough to travel around the world playing in incredible locations such as Italy and Portugal. 

I speak English, French, and a slowly increasing amount of Turkish (my father is Turkish).

While I do not know where my life will lead in the future, I hope to retain my passion for learning and experiencing the world in new ways.
